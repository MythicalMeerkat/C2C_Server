-----Commands to compile and run the program-----

Server:
- Compile: gcc -w server.c -o Server
- Running: ./Server 10001

Notes: 

I used port number 10001 for testing and running. If the server displays a binding error, change the port number until it works.
I hosted the server on eros.cs.txstate.edu. (IP: 147.26.231.152) It will work on other linux environments, the agent example below uses this IP.



Agent:
- Compile: gcc agent.c -o Agent
- Running: ./Agent 147.26.231.153 10001 "#ACTION"

Replace "#ACTION" with the following commands:
- "#JOIN"
- "#LEAVE"
- "#LIST"
- "#LOG"
